# TriboDataFAIR Ontology
An ontology of FAIR tribological experiments

The purpose of the ontology is to provide a controlled vocabulary of terms used to describe the scientific procedures in an experimental tribology lab. When used in conjunction with an Electronic Lab Notebook, the ontology provides the framework for creating a FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) data in experimental tribology. 

The scope of the ontology currently spans only one showcase experimental chain (soon to be published and linked here). The contents of the ontology are the result of >20 meetings of 10 domain experts where the minimum requisite terms to make tribological data interoperable were agreed upon. 

The ontology has been validated by reimplementing the showcase experiment and producing a "FAIR Data Package" (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5720626). Kadi4Mat (https://kadi.iam-cms.kit.edu/) was used to generate the data package.

In order to use the ontology for it purpose on can use SurfTheOWL (https://github.com/nick-garabedian/SurfTheOWL) as a start.

The software called Protégé (https://protege.stanford.edu/) was used for the development of the ontology, while SUMO (https://www.ontologyportal.org/) and EXPO (http://expo.sourceforge.net/) were used as foundational upper ontologies, and tribAIn (https://github.com/snow0815/tribAIn) was used to a limited extent when possible.
